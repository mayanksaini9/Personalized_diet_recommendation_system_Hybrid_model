# 🍎 Personalized Diet Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a **Personalized Diet Recommendation System** using advanced machine learning techniques. The system provides tailored dietary recommendations based on user preferences, nutritional needs, and health conditions. The best-performing model in this project is a hybrid approach combining **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** and **Gradient Boosting Regressor** using a **Voting Regressor**, achieving an impressive **SMAPE accuracy of 94.82%**.
